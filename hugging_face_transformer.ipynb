    "Adobe Sensei powers machine learning and artificial intelligence across all Adobe Cloud product lines. It enables thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Intelligent Services group within Creative Cloud releases the latest Adobe Sensei powered features within flagship products such as Photoshop or Illustrator. Recent popular features such as Neural Filters or Discover Panel have originated and been built by the group.\n",

    "The Opportunity\n",
    "Would you like to work on a blank canvas project that'll help improve the experience of creating content for millions of Adobe customers? We’re building a new team and you’ll get to drive significant portions of the technical roadmap by getting in early. This is a unique opportunity that combines the ability to build exciting, new user experiences for Adobe's customers, with the opportunity to work with large-scale machine learning.\n",
    "The Intelligent Services group’s latest mission is to build the Creative Copilot, an intelligent assistant that will help Adobe customers create original, high quality content. Creative Copilot is a system using transformers to assist creators with their workflows by providing a variety of next step recommendations. Building on earlier work on the creative assistant and latest advances in transformer technology (e.g. the Github copilot), the group is currently training machine learning models on large-scale data sets from Adobe applications & assets. The goal is to ultimately have the copilot present high-quality visual recommendations unobtrusively within Adobe applications.\n",
    "To make this mission a reality, we’re looking for applied ML scientists that train transformer & recommender models on the various asset and behavioral data sets at scale. This role will involve thinking hard about recommendation quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and new ways to evaluate recommendations at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you'll do :\n",
    "Collaborate with a team of ML Scientists, Engineers and Product Managers to build recommendation systems for creative tools and content\n",
    "Survey and understand prior literature to evaluate and recommend the best approaches for solving the problems at hand\n",
    "Design and implement algorithms that will power suggestions of layouts, fonts, color palettes, templates, tools and more in Adobe applications on desktop, web and mobile.\n",
    "Use the models and infrastructure from Adobe Research and Sensei to enable efficient reuse of technology across the company\n",
    "Write production quality code that scales for several million monthly users by maintaining a high bar for testing and productizing new algorithms\n",
    "Design NLP algorithms and build transformers & recommendation models from large scale data\n",
